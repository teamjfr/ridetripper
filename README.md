   1. Vehicle Owner will upload trip information(source, destination, number of seats available, approx. fare) from one place to another
   2. Passenger will select his pickup and destination.
   3. Trip information starting from within a certain radius ending near passengerâ€™s destination will show up
   4. Passenger will select his ride and contact informations will be shared between the groups
